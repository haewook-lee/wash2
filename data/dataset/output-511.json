It would be nice of you to get a drink while you're there, which I think you'll enjoy. Tea of the month is only $2+tax and smoothies start at about $4. Free parking. If you like boba in your drinks, Kaleisia really knows how it's done. I won't take boba from anywhere else in town. www.thetealounge.com",
