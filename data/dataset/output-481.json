Go past the elevator next to a big, very old mirror and keep going until you find a small wooden door. I think it's near the stairs. You'll know it when you see it. If you overlook it, ask the person at the lobby's desk. I am unsure if the men's room on the ground floor is a single stall, and I haven't been to it yet, so I don't know. \r\n\r\nThe door is too narrow to fit most wheelchairs and the bathroom is small. The building is very old and that part of it hasn't been updated for accessibility. ",
